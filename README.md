# Dragon Alpha 1.1.3

Note: The open source project was started many years ago and much of the notes, contact info, and resources may no longer work.  This respository is created to possibly contiue the project.

Dragon Alpha is a shareware role-playing game for Macintosh OS 8.6 and up.  Dragon Alpha runs natively under OS X.  It is a traditional RPG placed in a fantasy world.

How to build:<br>
To build the Dragon Alpha project, first copy all the files to the desired location.  Second, go to http://developer.apple.com/sdk/ and download the latest DrawSprocket SDK.  Place the DrawSprocket SDK folder in the root Dragon Alpha Source folder and replace all old instances of it.  Next open the Dragon Alpha project and compile.  The project should compile nice and clean.<br>

Editing Plug-Ins:<br>
Open the "Data" file in the plug-in package in an application such as ResEdit.  Use the TMPL resource file for viewing the plug-ins data.  The "Resources Notes" file should help with some of the available values for the appropriate fields.  The ".battle", ".map", ".map2", and ".mask" are actually just PICT files.<br>

Built-In Debug:<br>
In the actual location of Dragon Alpha in the Dragon Alpha package, there is a file "Debug.txt" that will show up if the application experiences errors while running.  This file will contain the error result code and the function in question.<br>
